# WP4, web version of P4 (Polynomial Planar Phase Portraits)

*This project is still in development.*

The aim of this project is to create a web version of <a href="htpps://github.com/oscarsaleta/P4">P4</a> with very limited functionality and host it in a public server, in order to make the P4 software available to a wider public (e.g. for users that do not have Maple).

## Acknowledgements

This project would not be possible without the support of Joan Torregrossa, and the original authors of P4: J. C. Art√©s, C. Herssens, P. De Maesschalck, F. Dumortier and J. Llibre.

## Want to try it locally?

**Requirements:**

* Compilation: **Wt library** (if you need the `wtfcgi` connector, you probably need to build Wt from source) and **CMake**.
* Execution: **P4** installed in `/usr/local/p4` (see <a href="https://github.com/oscarsaleta/P4#installation">P4 repository</a> for install instructions) [1], **Maple**.

**Step by step:**

* Clone this repository,
* Build the source with CMake (set `WT_CONNECTOR`),
* Change the name of the server configuration file: `cp wt_config.xml.example wt_config.xml`, and edit it if needed (for FCGI builds, `num-threads` should be more than 1).
* Run the *WP4.wt* executable using `--docroot` and any other necessary argument (see scripts *debug* or *release* for example wthttp commands).
* Use a web browser to test the web app.

<sup>[1] Actually, only the separate executables *lyapunov* and *separatrices* are needed from the P4 suite. WP4 does not need or use the P4 Qt application itself for working.</sup>
