 * 
 * @class HomeRight
 * 
 * This class derives from a WContainerWidget, and it serves as a container
 * for a WTabWidget (which is, in turn, a container widget organised by tabs).
 *
 * There are three tabs: <b>Output</b>, <b>Plot</b> and <b>Legend</b>.
 *
 * The <b>Output</b> tab has a text area where output generated by Maple is shown 
 * after an evaluation of a vector field, or where messages for the user
 * are printed. It also has 4 buttons: <i>Full results</i>, <i>Finite</i>,
 * <i>Infinite</i> and <i>Clear</i>. The three first buttons control
 * which results are shown in the output area, while the 4th button clears it.
 *
 * The <b>Plot</b> tab has a WPaintedWidget, which is a widget in which we can paint.
 * This tab holds the Poincaré sphere plots for the phase portraits of the
 * evaluated vector field. The plotting work is done by the #WWinSphere class,
 * which is instantiated inside HomeRight by a private @c WWinSphere @c sphere_
 * object.
 *
 * The <b>Legend</b> tab simply holds a static image picked from the original P4.
 * It shows the legend of the plots (kinds of singular points, etc).
 *
 * There are three methods in this class that are designed to act
 * upon the receival of a signal from #HomeLeft.
